# titanic-survival-prediction
🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning  This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning classification techniques. It is a beginner-friendly, end-to-end ML project that demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

Project Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. While some passengers survived, many did not. This project uses passenger data to build a machine learning model that predicts survival based on attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

Problem Type: Binary Classification
Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows a standard ML pipeline:
1)Understanding the problem
2)Loading the dataset
3)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4)Data cleaning and preprocessing
5)Encoding categorical variables
6)Train–test split
7)Model training (Logistic Regression)
8)Model evaluation
9)Results and conclusions
